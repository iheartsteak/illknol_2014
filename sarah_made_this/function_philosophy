# Function and Philosophy 

>This is where the religious wars usually start. And rightfully so. If, like me, your digital life mostly revolves around text, then you need to have a religious fervor for your text editor. When I meet a geek who does not feel strongly about their choice of text editor (or worse, uses notepad or gedit), all my “fake geek” alarms go off. As far as software goes, this is the centerpiece of the entire set up.

### the idea
I am proposing to conduct research for an article tentatively titled, Function and Philosophy. I am interested in investigating and understanding why people choose the tools that they do. Everyone has preferences, but it seems that tools for computers, software, are evaluated on more than just their functionality.
There are 


There is an endless list of programs and components I could look at, but I have narrowed it down (and might possibly reduce it more), to: operating systems, text programs--plain text or not, and if plain text what software, web browser and language. I have selected these because through my enitial research these are the programs/formats surrounded with the highest contention. The arguments go back and forth about desgin, format,ease, but the most heated debates are about what could be summed up as ethics. The themes that have come up again and again are: control, choice, freedom.



Here is a collection of what I have found to be the most commonly mentioned software:  
#####Text editors Bluegriffon BbeditCodaIrssinvALTtextwranglerchocolateAcmeTexmate LatexVim Sublime text 2BluefishGimpSublime text 3Atom Chromium  

-not only just the types of softwar, but also the debate between to use or not to use.  
#####Languagesruby pythonjavac#  
#####Web browser Chrome FirefoxIceweaselEpiphanyVpnSafari  
#####Operating SystemsOs x LinuxWindowsRedhatDebianopensuseunitygnome3 arch linuzGentooos x maverick (I found that some people who use linux refered to themselves as Nix guys..?)

Programers make their own tools. Not many other professions have the ability to make the tools they need to ply their craft. Carpenters don't make drills. They might know how to use them, but they would not be able to build one, nor would they want to. Programers and other computer-centric workers not only know how to use the tools of their trade, but they also know how they were made, how they work, probably who made them and why. Because of this unique relationship, this closeness, there seems to be more passion invloved in choosing. 


###the plan
1. get a better understanding of the programs/software/etc I am going to be asking about. 
2. continue to compile a list of people to interview about their choices. 
3. get intouch with the authors of the programs and talk to them about their philosophy and process in regards to said product

### some sources

There are many forums, such as [thesetup](http://usesthis.com/), where people share the tools they use and why.
